Safe
====
Minecraft mod that adds a safe block to protect items you store in it from other people.

Safe can't be destroyed except in creative or by owner. It works as chest and lets you store 36 items in it. Hover your mouse over the chest, and a name will pop up - that's the name of the person who owns it. Only that person can open the safe. Once the safe is open, anyone can get inside and grab something. The safe gets closed when no player is inside its inventory.

Safe blocks are affected by gravity and fall, breaking blocks and hurting players and mobs.

If a safe block is exploded with TNT, it gets cracked. Safe blocks can't get more than one crack per one real life day. After getting 6 cracks, safe block is destroyed.

Craft it using 4 iron ingots and 4 iron blocks:
